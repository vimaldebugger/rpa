        Steps

                
                    
    
    
                    Step 1
                
                
                    To make the custard, combine the custard powder (2 tbsp custard powder) and sugar (2 tbsp caster sugar) in a small saucepan. Add 2 tbsp of the milk (310ml (1 1/4 cups) milk) and stir until smooth. Place over medium heat and stir in the remaining milk. Bring to the boil, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring occasionally, for a further 2 minutes or until thickened (300ml thickened cream, whipped, for topping). Transfer to a bowl and set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly, stirring occasionally to release the heat. Cover surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until cooled but not chilled.
                
                            
                
                    
    
    
                    Step 2
                
                
                    Meanwhile, to make the mousse, combine milk (250ml (1 cup) milk), brown sugar (100g (1/2 cup, firmly packed) brown sugar) and vanilla (2 tsp vanilla extract) in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir for 2 minutes or until sugar has dissolved and mixture is hot but not boiling. Soak the gelatine (5 sheets gelatine) leaves in a bowl of cold water for about 3 minutes or until soft. Lift gelatine out of the bowl and squeeze out the excess water. Add to the hot milk mixture and stir to dissolve. Pour into a bowl and cool slightly. Refrigerate, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes or until cooled but not chilled or set.

                    Step 3
                
                
                    Release the base from a 21cm springform pan. Line the base with baking paper, allowing a 4cm overhang. Secure the base back in the pan. Trim savoiardi biscuits (20 savoiardi (sponge finger biscuits) (see note)) so they are the same height as the inside wall of the pan. Arrange around the edge. Place offcuts over the base of the pan (they won’t cover completely).
                
                            
                
                    
    
    
                    Step 4
                
                
                    To finish the mousse, beat the cream (375ml (1 1/2 cups) thickened cream) until soft peaks form. Add the milk mixture and beat until combined (it will be slightly runny). Spread 1 cup of mousse mixture over the biscuits in the base of the pan. Arrange apple slices (410g can Coles pink lady apple slices) on top. Cover with custard, reserving about 1/4 cup.
                
                            
                
                    
    
    
                    Step 5
                
                
                    Pour the remaining mousse mixture into the pan. Add reserved custard and use a skewer to create a swirled effect. Refrigerate for 4 hours or until set.
                
                            
                
                    
    
    
                    Step 6
                
                
                    To serve, dollop with whipped cream and drizzle with caramel sauce (Caramel sauce, to drizzle).
